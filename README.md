an EXTREMELY unbalanced jokerforge mod made by GreenKookie
which requires Steamodded and Talisman to work

# What is this mod about?
this is a btd6/plague inc related mod about everything I found funny/interesting and decided to add into the game, which includes:
- stupidly broken/unbalanced ideas
- unfunny inside jokes
- arts that I drew (Some were made just to be funny, some were just me having nothing to do and deciding to waste 2 hours on a 69x91)
- towers in btd6 old versions that absolutely peaked/sucked during the period
- plagues that demonstrate their playstyle in the plague inc game
- decks but jokers, have nothing to do with deck effects and instead have something to do with deck-related numbers, extremely expensive and only appears in shop
