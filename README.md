# Welcome to Sholium!

an unbalanced jokerforge mod made by GreenKookie

note: this mod requires Steamodded and Talisman to work

# What is this mod about?
this is a bloons (mainly btd6) related mod about everything I found funny/interesting and decided to add into the game, which includes:
- stupidly broken/unbalanced cards compared to vanilla
- unfunny inside jokes
- arts that I drew for a few hours (Some needs to at least look cool/funny, some are just me having nothing to do and deciding to waste 2 hours on a 69x91)
- towers in btd6 old versions that absolutely peaked/sucked during that period

# I prefer vanilla balance but i still want to see bloons content...
